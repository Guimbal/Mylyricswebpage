<h1><b><u>Lyrics</u></b></h1>
<h1><b><u>Bob Marley</u></b></h1>
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
They say the sun a na shine for all<br>
But in some people world<br>

<h1><b><u>YG Marley Chorus</u></b></h1
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
It never shine at all<br>
These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh<br>
Showed you I loved you, and you called me a liar<br>
Oh, no, no, no, no, no<br>

<h1><b><u>Verse 1</u></b></h1
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone<br>
I've been fiendin' for your love so long<br>
We can praise Jah in the moonlight<br>
Baby, if you with me better do right<br>
And I've been gone too long<br>
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs<br> (sing my songs)<br>
I've been on this road for way too long<br>
I've been hoping that we all get along<br>

<h1><b><u>Chorus</u></b></h1
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh<br>
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar<br>

<h1><b><u>Verse 2</u></b></h1
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
I've been on my own all along<br>
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone<br>
And if I'm telling you the feeling is wrong<br>
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long<br>
And when you're feeling alone<br>
You can call my phone<br>
Is there a better way to go?<br>
Teach them something before they lose their soul<br>
Oh, no, no, no freedom is the road<br>
Oh, no, no, no coming in from the cold<br>
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold<br>
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br>
They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets (ahh)<br>
Now you're caught up in a funk with the optic, with the vision (ahh)<br>
Trying to control your soul and take control<br>
Oh, no, no, no (ahh)<br>
No, we don't play that game right here to win power (ahh)<br>

<h1><b><u>Bridge</u></b></h1
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)<br> give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)<br> I sing, give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)<br> give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)<br> give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)<br> give Jah the thanks and praises<br>
Oh, give Jah all the thanks, the thanks<br>
The thanks, the thanks, the thanks (give Jah thanks and)<br>
The thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks (praises)<br>
Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks and praises (praises)<br>

(Give Jah thanks and)<br>
Give Jah the thanks and praises (praises, praises)<br>
(Give Jah thanks and praises, praises)<br>

(Give Him the thanks and the praises)<br>
